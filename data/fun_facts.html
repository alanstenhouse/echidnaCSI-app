<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">The echidna and their cousin the platypus are the <b>world&rsquo;s oldest mammals</b> &ndash; they are almost 200 million years old!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">Echidnas and platypuses are called monotremes. The word monotreme literally means<b> &lsquo;one hole&rsquo;</b>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">Monotremes are the only <b>egg-laying</b> mammals. The egg is only the size of a grape and the shell is very thin, fragile and has a leathery texture. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">Echidnas only breed during July-September every year, so that is the <b>best time to spot them</b> in the wild as they are most active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">Echidnas on Kangaroo Island are now listed as <b>endangered</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">Male echidnas have a <b>four-headed penis</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">Echidnas appear on our 5-cent coin, baby echidnas are so small after they hatch from their egg that it would take <b>8 baby echidnas</b> to weigh as much as a single 5-cent coin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">A baby echidna is called a <b>puggle</b>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">Some echidnas <b>hibernate</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">Unlike all other mammals that have 2 sex chromosomes (XX females, XY males), female echidnas have <b>10 sex chromosomes</b> (10X) and <b>males have 9</b> (5X4Y). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">The spines of echidnas are just <b>really thick hairs</b>, they&rsquo;re made out of keratin, which is the same as what our hair and fingernails are made of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">Echidnas&rsquo; <b>hind feet point backwards</b>. This is to help them dig better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">Echidnas have a <b>lower body temperature</b> than other mammals, resting at around 30 &deg;C. Their body temperature can also fluctuate 6-8 &deg;C during the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">You can&rsquo;t tell if an echidna is male or female by simply looking at them as they have <b>no gender-specific features</b> and their <b>reproductive organs are internal</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p firstindent="-22" leftindent="36" spacebelow="10">All echidnas are born with <b>spurs on their hind limbs</b>, similar to what male platypuses have. They are not venomous like in platypus, but the glands underneath the spurs <b>secrete pheromones</b> used for attracting each other during breeding season. Females are meant to lose the spurs as they mature but some retain the spurs, while some males lose them. </p>
