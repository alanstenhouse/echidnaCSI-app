And we can start filling in the knowledge gaps about our beautiful echidnas.		<br>		<br><b>Poo really?</b>		<br>Don't just look for echidnas keep an eye out for their poo (i.e. scats) too! And send it to us!		<br><b>Why?</b> There’s a lot of cool stuff in echidna poo. 		<br>Like:		<br>a)	DNA from the <b>echidna</b> itself		<br>b)	DNA from <b>plants</b> in it's environment		<br>c)	DNA from <b>food</b> it's eaten (e.g. ants)		<br>d)	Hormones that indicate <b>stress</b>		<br>e)	Hormones that indicate <b>pregnancy</b><br>			<!--img src="file://grutznerlab.weebly.com/uploads/9/9/2/0/99206000/poo-image-cropped_orig.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain' align="middle"--> 			<!--img src="file:./poo-image-cropped_orig.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain' align="middle"--> 			<img src="file:poo-image-cropped_orig.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain' align="middle"> 		<br><b>What do echidna scats look like?</b>		<br>Echidna scats are quite distinguishable. They are long and thick, very dry in texture and quite large too! You also should be able to spot lots of ants and termites in echidna scats, as this is what they eat. 		<br>		<br>Take a look at the images below that show you what an echidna scat looks like and how they compare to other native animals.		<br>			<!--img src="http://grutznerlab.weebly.com/uploads/9/9/2/0/99206000/scat1-450x600_1_orig.png" style="width:350px;height:275px" align="middle"--> 			<img src="file:./SCAT1.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain' align="middle"> 		<b>Example of what an echidna scat looks like.
